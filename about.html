        <p>A vehicle (from Latin vehiculum)[1] is a machine designed for self propulsion, usually to transport people or cargo, or both. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (for example, motorcycles, motor cars, trucks, buses and powered wheelchairs and scooters for disabled people), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats, underwater vehicles), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicles, hovercraft), aircraft (planes, helicopters, aerostats) and spacecraft.[2]

            Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.[3]
            <br>
            The oldest boats found by archaeological excavation are logboats, with the oldest logboat found, the Pesse canoe found in a bog in the Netherlands, being carbon dated to 8040 - 7510 BC, making it 9,500–10,000 years old,[4][5][6][7]
            A 7,000 year-old seagoing boat made from reeds and tar has been found in Kuwait.[8]
            Boats were used between 4000 -3000 BC in Sumer,[9] ancient Egypt[10] and in the Indian Ocean.[9]
            There is evidence of camel pulled wheeled vehicles about 4000–3000 BC.[11]<br>
            The earliest evidence of a wagonway, a predecessor of the railway, found so far was the 6 to 8.5 km (4 to 5 mi) long Diolkos wagonway, which transported boats across the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece since around 600 BC.[12][13] Wheeled vehicles pulled by men and animals ran in grooves in limestone, which provided the track element, preventing the wagons from leaving the intended route.[13]
            In 200 CE, Ma Jun built a south-pointing chariot, a vehicle with an early form of guidance system.[14]
            The stagecoach, a four wheeled vehicle drawn by horses, originated in 13th century England.[15]
            Railways began reappearing in Europe after the Dark Ages. The earliest known record of a railway in Europe from this period is a stained-glass window in the Minster of Freiburg im Breisgau dating from around 1350.[16]<br>
            In 1515, Cardinal Matthäus Lang wrote a description of the Reisszug, a funicular railway at the Hohensalzburg Fortress in Austria. The line originally used wooden rails and a hemp haulage rope and was operated by human or animal power, through a treadwheel.[17][18]<br>
            1769 Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is often credited with building the first self-propelled mechanical vehicle or automobile in 1769.[19]<br>
            In Russia, in the 1780s, Ivan Kulibin developed a human-pedalled, three-wheeled carriage with modern features such as a flywheel, brake, gear box and bearings; however, it was not developed further.[20]
            1783 Montgolfier brothers first balloon vehicle
            1801 Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, which many believe was the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle, though it could not maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.
            1817 Pushbikes (now a British informal term for bicycles), draisines or hobby horses were the first human means of transport to make use of the two-wheeler principle, the draisienne (or Laufmaschine, "running machine"), invented by the German Baron Karl von Drais, is regarded as the forerunner of the modern bicycle (and motorcycle). It was introduced by Drais to the public in Mannheim in summer 1817.[21]
            1885 Karl Benz built (and subsequently patented) the first automobile, powered by his own four-stroke cycle gasoline engine in Mannheim, Germany
            1885 Otto Lilienthal began experimental gliding and achieved the first sustained, controlled, reproducible flights.
            1903 Wright brothers flew the first controlled, powered aircraft
            1907 First helicopters Gyroplane no.1 (tethered) and Cornu helicopter (free flight)[22]</p>
